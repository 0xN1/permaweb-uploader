# Permaweb Uploader

This is an Arweave uploader using Bundlr Network. Build using NextJS, TailwindCSS and react-filepond.

---

## Brief

We need to upload files to Arweave, found out about Bundlr Network and there it is. :)

## Features

-   Drag and drop
-   Simple UI
-   Save history as CSV

## Notes

This is a simple uploader, using react-filepond to assist with the drag and drop.

After using this for a while, we found out that we're copying and paste the data manually.

So we added the CSV export feature to export the data. We can use anywhere CSV is supported, in this case we use Notion.

## Installation

Install dependencies and start dev server

```
yarn && yarn dev
```

Run locally

```
yarn start
```
